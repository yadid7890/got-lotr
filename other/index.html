                        <p>Black Mirror in an amazing sci-fi series that combines some of my favorite topics: scifi, video games, social media, mystery, thrills, fantasy! I also recommend Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams on Hulu.</p>

                        <p>The Flash has been one of my favorite super heroes since I was younger. The tv series is exciting! The cast is amazing and the red suit looks great!</p>

                        <p>Yes, I am a big fan of Avatar the Last Airbender. The idea of bending was brought to life in such a great series! The storytelling was captivating and the action unforgetable.

                        <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is by far the best video game I've ever played. And I've played many. HZD immerses the user into Aloy's story in such an impactful and engaging manner that you just have to play for hourse! The gameplay is fun, the foes complex, and the environment is incredibly realistic. I've played this game for more than 100 hours!</p>

                        <figcaption>Kingdom Hearts</figcaption>
                        <p>If I had to pick one Square Enix series to name my favorite, I would say Kingdom Hearts (though that may change to the Final Fantasy series after the Final Fantasy 7 remake drops at the end of 2019). Kingdom Hearts was one of the first video game series I truly enjoyed enough to play the whole series. Interesting, refreshing, fun, nostalgic. The KH series is a journey I recommend everyone to experience at least once.

                        <p> Monster Hunter World is an open world games where you get to kill giant, beautifully designed beasts. What else can I say? The main point of the game is to buy costumes for your cat companion. Sold?
